# deepbind_ImplicitFingerprinting
#Journal Paper : Repository of relevant code snippets for Implicit Fingerprinting based virtual screening on ChEMBL data. 

This repository contains the additional supporting material for the journal paper titled "Implicit-descriptor ligand-based virtualscreening by means of collaborative filtering" 

With this paper we introduce a new method of ligand fingerprinting called Implicit Fingerprinting and demonstrate its abilities to aid in binding affinity predictions with biological targets.
